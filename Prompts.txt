AI Tooling Prompts Log 

1. This is an open-book test. So assignment takers are free to use any GPT tool of their choice.

The first qualification criteria is a running application. So ensure the readme and packaging are correct and you test it.

Github usage is mandatory and codebase/build scripts/configs are to be present there.

Any non-functional items taken care of like adding security layer, performance etc please add in the readme. These earn you bonus points.

2. Design a step-by-step guide for setting up a development environment for a Java project using Maven as the build tool.The guide should include the following elements: 1.**Installation Requirements:** - List the necessary software to install (e.g., Java Development Kit, Maven, Git).- Provide links to official installation guides for each software.2.**Maven Project Structure:** - Explain the standard Maven project directory structure (src/main/java, src/test/java, pom.xml, etc.).- Describe the purpose of each directory and file in the structure.3.**Creating a New Maven Project:** - Provide commands to create a new Maven project using the command line.- Include an example of a simple `pom.xml` file with essential dependencies.

3. error: package com.durableengine.engine does not exist
	
4. initialize a Maven project, configure SQLite for database queries, and create a Java file within the 'engine' package to manage the database configuration. Include step-by-step instructions, code snippets, and best practices for setting up the project structure, dependencies, and any necessary configurations for SQLite integration.

5. java version is 21, make changes on pom.xml accordingly

6. Create a complete, runnable app.java file that tests database creation. The assistant should include all necessary imports, a main method, and database connection logic that attempts to create a database and reports success or failure.

7.Successfully generated the SQLite database file but encountered SLF4J binding warnings. what are those warning?

8.Create a Java file named asWorkflowEngine.java that implements a workflow engine capable of:
Executing multiple workflows in parallel using thread pools or async execution
Storing workflow definitions, execution states, and results in SQLite
Managing task dependencies and execution order within workflows
Tracking workflow progress and status in the database
Handling errors and retries with database logging



9. build the required onboarding example java file

10. Update app.java to make it suitable for testing by implementing best practices that enable unit tests, integration tests, or other testing methodologies to be written against it effectively.
